        <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
        <ul class="hobbies">
            <li>Programming</li>

            <p>Programming has always interested me as a child, because I wanted to know how
            the computer was able to run different programs I played with. I wanted to figure out
            how a computer could be so smart. I took a programming class in highschool and was thrust into
            the programming world. I then got a scholarship for the TechTrack to learn web development.
            Now I know C, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Git. <p>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <a href="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/images_blogs/wiredscience/2014/01/books.jpg"><img src="books.jpg" alt="Books Picture"></a>
            <p>I really like to read, but I only read one genre. Fiction.
            All the other genres are boring to me, because you don't get to use your
            imagination as much. Some books that I have read and recommend are Eragon, The Lord of the Rings, 
            and Mistborn. These books will give you a great feel for the genre.</p>
            <li>Video Games</li>
            <a href="http://hypebeast.com/image/2016/02/legend-of-zelda-turns-30-0.jpg"><img src="legend-of-zelda.jpg" alt="Zelda Picture"></a>
            <p>Video games are more popular then ever, and I too have been sucked into
            this virtual world. Gaming is a part of the now, and this is part of the reason
            I wanted to program so bad. My favorite gaming company is Nintendo, because they have
            amazing games that are fine to play with your kids. Some game series you should look into are
            The Legend of Zelda, Mario, and Metroid.</p>
            <li>Biking</li>
            <a href="http://bicycleupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BuyingGuide_RoadBiking_Intro_664-01943960c_447x286_v2.jpg"><img src="biking.jpg" alt="Biking Picture"></a>
            <p>I really like to bike. Whether we are mountain biking or street biking it really doesn't matter to me.
            This is my favorite kind of exercise, because you get to move at high speeds
            and you get to watch the scenery as it zips past. Feeling the wind blow in your 
            face is just wonderful thing. That's all for my main hobbies.</p>
