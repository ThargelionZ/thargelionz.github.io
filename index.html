            <p>Programming has always interested me as a child, because I wanted to know how
            the computer was able to run different programs I played with. I wanted to figure out
            how a computer could be so smart. I took a programming class in highschool and was thrust into
            the programming world. I then got a scholarship for the TechTrack to learn web development.
            Now I know C, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Git. <p>
