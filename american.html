            <h3>American</h3>
            <p class="intro">American food is known as Junk Food. Most countries don't like american food because of how crappy it is.
            It tastes great because of all the unhealthy things that are in it, and incredibly cheap, but it's incredibly bad for you. Of course I am talking 
            about America's fast food that is so popular. We love burgers, we love french fries, and we love soda. Let's get started on that fattiest and best tasting
            foods here in America. </p>

                <p class="caption burger">An American Burger - $39.99</p>
            </div>
            <p class="content1">The burger is a delicious sandwhich made of buns, meat, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and many other
            toppings you can add for only $2.99 per topping. The calories in this burger are relatively high, but
            it is worth the wonderful experience it gives your taste buds.</p>

                <p class="caption fries">Some Fries - $19.99</p>
            </div>
            <p class="content2">The American/French Fries are a delicious side or snack that you can include with your meal. You can choose salt or no-salt, but no-salt costs $1.99
            more. </p>
