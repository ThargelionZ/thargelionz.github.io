        <div class="intro">
            <p>Smash Bros. Wii U/3DS is a fighting game made by Nintendo, where you the player can choose out of 58 characters (7 of which are available only through
            downloadable content) and use them to fight others and (hopefully) win a match. There are many game modes in smash, but for now we will just take a look at what is
            in the versus mode. You can either play with time or with stock. First, let's discuss time mode. This consists of fighting each other and and getting the most KO's in the given time. 
            Stock on the other hand is unlimited time, but you have a limited number of lives. If you wish you can put a time limit on your stock matches. You also may use items or no items. Items are for a more casual fun experience
            while no items is purely skill based, and I personally tend to choose the latter of the two. This article covers the fighting part of smash. Alternate modes like all-star and multi-man will be talked about in another article.
            Anyways, on to learning how to fight. If you are a beginner, this is the place for you. Read on to the basics down below to get started. For those who are looking to boost your skill, scroll down to the more advanced section. 
            If you want to learn the techniques that can be used for those more advanced, we have a section for you as well. I hope this how-to will help you learn what you need to get better at Smash. (Check out Nintendo's beginners guide if you
            find this difficult: <a href="http://www.smashbros.com/us/howto/entry3.html">Basic Controls</a>).</p>

        <h2>The Basics</h2>
        <div class="the-basics">
            <p>NOTE: Before we begin I would like to mention that all controls that I am refering to will be for the
            Wii U GamePad and the Wii U Pro Controller.</p>
            <h3>Standard Attack (Neutral)</h3>
            <p>The standard attack is performed by pressing the A button alone. This will result in a quick low damage attack
            that can surprise your opponent. Neutral attacks do have combos for some characters, such as Captain Falcon who has a three hit combo (A, A, A) or Samus who has a two hit
            combo (A, A).</p>
