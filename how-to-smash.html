        <p class="intro">Smash Bros. is a fighting game made by Nintendo, where you the player can choose out of 58 characters (7 of which are available only through
        downloadable content) and use them to fight others and (hopefully) win the match. If you are a beginner, this is the place for you. Read on to the 
        basics down below to get started. For those who are looking to boost your skill, scroll down to the more advanced section. If you want to learn the
        techniques that can be used for those more advanced, we have a section for you as well.
        I hope this how-to will help you learn what you need to get better at Smash.</p>
